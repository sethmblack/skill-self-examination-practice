# Self-Examination Practice

A structured self-reflection practice based on Confucian principles. Before seeking to change others, examine yourself. Before criticizing, look inward. This is the root of all moral progress.

---

## When to Use

- Frustration with others' behavior or character
- Before giving critical feedback or confronting someone
- Daily or periodic reflection practice
- When feeling stuck in interpersonal conflict
- When blame is directed outward
- When someone asks "What should I do about them?"
- When the easier path is changing oneself rather than changing others

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | Description of frustration, conflict, or concern |
| other_party | No | Who you're frustrated with or want to change |
| your_actions | No | What you've done in this situation |

## The Confucian Foundation

Zengzi, Confucius's disciple, said: "I daily examine myself on three points: In planning for others, have I failed to be loyal? In intercourse with friends, have I failed to be trustworthy? Have I failed to practice what I teach?" (Analects I-4)

Confucius taught: "When you see a worthy person, endeavor to emulate them. When you see an unworthy person, examine yourself." (IV-17)

The Master understood that we can only control ourselves. To focus on others' faults while ignoring our own is to guarantee failure. The one person we can always change is ourselves—and often, changing ourselves changes everything.

## The Three-Point Examination

### Point 1: Loyalty (Zhong)

**Core question:** In my dealings with others, have I been truly loyal to their interests?

Examine:
- When advising others, did I truly consider what was best for them, or what was convenient for me?
- Did I tell them what they needed to hear, or what I wanted to say?
- Did I act in their genuine interest, or pursue my own agenda while claiming to help?
- When they weren't present, did I represent their interests faithfully?

**Signs of failure:**
- Advice that benefits you disguised as concern for them
- Withholding information that would serve them
- Speaking differently about them than to them
- Acting primarily on your own timeline or convenience

### Point 2: Trustworthiness (Xin)

**Core question:** In my relationships, have I been truly trustworthy?

Examine:
- Did I keep my commitments—explicit and implicit?
- Did my words align with my actions?
- Did I do what I said I would do, when I said I would do it?
- Can others rely on what I say as an accurate reflection of what I'll do?

**Signs of failure:**
- Promises made and forgotten
- Words spoken but not meant
- Commitments made and excuses offered
- Saying yes when you meant no

### Point 3: Practice (Xi)

**Core question:** Have I practiced what I preach?

Examine:
- The standards I hold others to—do I meet them myself?
- The advice I give—do I follow it?
- The virtues I admire—do I cultivate them?
- The faults I criticize—are they absent from me?

**Signs of failure:**
- Expecting what you don't model
- Teaching what you don't practice
- Criticizing faults you yourself possess
- Standards that apply to others but not to you

## The Expanded Framework

Beyond Zengzi's three points, examine additional dimensions:

### 4: The Mirror Question

"The fault I see in them—does it exist in me?"

Often what frustrates us most in others is a reflection of our own shadow. The coworker whose disorganization irritates you may mirror your own hidden chaos. The friend whose excuses frustrate you may reflect your own tendency to avoid responsibility.

### 5: The Contribution Question

"What have I contributed to this situation?"

No conflict is purely one-sided. Even if the other person bears more fault, examine:
- What did I do (or fail to do) that contributed?
- How did my actions enable or provoke their behavior?
- What early signals did I ignore?
- Where was my first mistake?

### 6: The Control Question

"What can I actually change here?"

Distinguish between:
- What is within my control (my actions, my responses, my interpretations)
- What is within my influence (my example, my requests, my boundaries)
- What is outside my control (their choices, their character, their responses)

The only reliable path is working on what you control.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Self-Examination Practice

### Situation
[Brief restatement of the frustration or conflict]

### The Other (as you see them)
[What you're frustrated about; what you want them to change]

### The Three Points

**1. Loyalty**
- Have I been truly loyal to their interests?
- [Honest assessment]
- [Where I may have fallen short]

**2. Trustworthiness**
- Have I kept my word?
- [Honest assessment]
- [Where I may have fallen short]

**3. Practice**
- Am I practicing what I expect of them?
- [Honest assessment]
- [Where I may have fallen short]

### The Mirror
[What fault in them might exist in me?]

### My Contribution
[What have I done to create or worsen this situation?]

### What I Control
| Within my control | Within my influence | Outside my control |
|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| [My actions] | [My example] | [Their choices] |

### The Path Forward
[What I can do—starting with myself—before asking anything of them]

### If I Change First
[What might become possible if I address my own faults first]
```

## Constraints

- Be genuinely honest—this practice only works with real self-examination
- Do not use this as another way to focus on the other person's faults
- Acknowledge that finding fault in yourself doesn't mean excusing others
- Recognize that sometimes self-examination reveals you are indeed in the right—but even then, consider your manner of being right
- This practice precedes action; it doesn't replace appropriate action

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "My business partner keeps missing deadlines and making excuses. I'm doing all the work while they coast. How do I get them to pull their weight?"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Self-Examination Practice

### Situation
Business partnership where one party feels they're carrying the load while the other underperforms.

### The Other (as you see them)
Your partner misses deadlines, makes excuses, and doesn't pull their weight. You feel burdened, resentful, perhaps even exploited.

### The Three Points

**1. Loyalty**
- Have I been truly loyal to my partner's interests?
- When I've noticed their struggles, have I sought to understand or just to judge?
- Have I communicated my concerns in service of the partnership, or in venting my frustration?
- Have I represented them fairly to others, or have I complained about them?

*Honest assessment:* I may have been speaking to others about my frustrations before speaking clearly to them. I may have assumed bad intent rather than inquiring into what's happening for them.

**2. Trustworthiness**
- Have I kept my word in this partnership?
- Have I been clear about my expectations, or assumed they would know?
- Did I make agreements about workload that I'm now silently modifying?
- Have I been honest about my growing resentment, or let it fester unspoken?

*Honest assessment:* I haven't directly said "I feel I'm doing more than my share." I've made hints and shown frustration, but I haven't been trustworthy in speaking clearly.

**3. Practice**
- Am I practicing what I expect of them?
- Do I meet my own deadlines with the same standard I hold them to?
- When I struggle, do I make excuses they might consider similar to theirs?
- Am I modeling the communication I want from them?

*Honest assessment:* I do sometimes run late on things and explain why. I might call those "reasons" while I call theirs "excuses." The standard might not be as one-sided as I've told myself.

### The Mirror
The "excuses" I'm frustrated with—do I make them too?
The failure to communicate—am I doing the same by not addressing this directly?
The coasting—is there any part of this partnership where I coast?

Perhaps what frustrates me most is seeing in them a tendency I fear in myself.

### My Contribution
- I accepted a partnership structure without clear agreements about workload
- I didn't raise concerns when they were small; now they're large
- I've built resentment silently, which poisons my interactions
- I may have taken on work without being asked, then resented the imbalance I created
- I haven't modeled the direct, honest communication I want

### What I Control
| Within my control | Within my influence | Outside my control |
|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Speaking clearly about my experience | Proposing new agreements | Whether they change |
| Managing my resentment | Modeling the work ethic I want | Their priorities |
| Deciding if this partnership works for me | Requesting accountability structures | Their excuses |
| My own deadline discipline | The tone of our relationship | Their capacity |

### The Path Forward
Before demanding change from my partner:
1. Acknowledge that I haven't been trustworthy in communication—I owe them clarity before criticism
2. Examine whether my standards for them are the same as for myself
3. Have a direct conversation about my experience: "I feel I'm carrying more of the load. I want to understand your perspective, and I want to share mine honestly."
4. Propose concrete structures rather than demanding character change

### If I Change First
If I model direct, honest communication instead of resentful hinting, the conversation becomes possible. If I take responsibility for my failure to address this sooner, I invite them to take responsibility too. If I ask genuine questions about their experience, I might learn something that changes my understanding.

And if, after genuine self-examination and clear communication, they still don't fulfill their role—then I can act from clarity rather than accumulated resentment.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Confucius** expert persona. Use it before addressing conflict with others. The Master taught that self-cultivation is the root of all good order. Begin there.
