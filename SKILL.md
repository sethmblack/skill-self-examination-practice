# Self-Examination Practice

A structured self-reflection practice based on Confucian principles. Before seeking to change others, examine yourself. Before criticizing, look inward. This is the root of all moral progress.

Zengzi, Confucius's disciple, said: "I daily examine myself on three points: In planning for others, have I failed to be loyal? In intercourse with friends, have I failed to be trustworthy? Have I failed to practice what I teach?" This practice operationalizes that teaching. When frustrated with others, when blame is directed outward, when the impulse is to demand change from someone else, this skill redirects attention to the one person you can actually change: yourself. This is not about self-blame or avoiding confrontation when confrontation is warranted. It is about ensuring that before you demand something of another, you have examined whether you are meeting that same standard yourself. Often, this examination reveals that changing oneself changes everything. Even when it does not, action taken after genuine self-examination is cleaner, clearer, and more effective than action taken in blind projection.

## Core Principle

"When you see a worthy person, endeavor to emulate them. When you see an unworthy person, examine yourself." - Confucius, Analects IV-17

The Master understood that we can only control ourselves. To focus on others' faults while ignoring our own is to guarantee failure. The one person we can always change is ourselves - and often, changing ourselves changes everything.

## Methodology

### Phase 1: The Traditional Three-Point Examination

**Point 1: Loyalty (Zhong)**

Core question: In my dealings with others, have I been truly loyal to their interests?

Examine:
- When advising others, did I truly consider what was best for them, or what was convenient for me?
- Did I tell them what they needed to hear, or what I wanted to say?
- Did I act in their genuine interest, or pursue my own agenda while claiming to help?
- When they weren't present, did I represent their interests faithfully?

Signs of failure:
- Advice that benefits you disguised as concern for them
- Withholding information that would serve them
- Speaking differently about them than to them
- Acting primarily on your own timeline or convenience

**Point 2: Trustworthiness (Xin)**

Core question: In my relationships, have I been truly trustworthy?

Examine:
- Did I keep my commitments - explicit and implicit?
- Did my words align with my actions?
- Did I do what I said I would do, when I said I would do it?
- Can others rely on what I say as an accurate reflection of what I'll do?

Signs of failure:
- Promises made and forgotten
- Words spoken but not meant
- Commitments made and excuses offered
- Saying yes when you meant no

**Point 3: Practice (Xi)**

Core question: Have I practiced what I preach?

Examine:
- The standards I hold others to - do I meet them myself?
- The advice I give - do I follow it?
- The virtues I admire - do I cultivate them?
- The faults I criticize - are they absent from me?

Signs of failure:
- Expecting what you don't model
- Teaching what you don't practice
- Criticizing faults you yourself possess
- Standards that apply to others but not to you

### Phase 2: The Expanded Examination

**The Mirror Question:** "The fault I see in them - does it exist in me?"

Often what frustrates us most in others is a reflection of our own shadow. The coworker whose disorganization irritates you may mirror your own hidden chaos. The friend whose excuses frustrate you may reflect your own tendency to avoid responsibility.

**The Contribution Question:** "What have I contributed to this situation?"

No conflict is purely one-sided. Even if the other person bears more fault, examine:
- What did I do (or fail to do) that contributed?
- How did my actions enable or provoke their behavior?
- What early signals did I ignore?
- Where was my first mistake?

**The Control Question:** "What can I actually change here?"

Distinguish between:
- What is within my control (my actions, my responses, my interpretations)
- What is within my influence (my example, my requests, my boundaries)
- What is outside my control (their choices, their character, their responses)

The only reliable path is working on what you control.

### Phase 3: The Path Forward

After examination, determine:
1. What can you change about yourself that would improve the situation?
2. What would you need to do first, before asking anything of them?
3. If you changed first, what might become possible?

## Constraints

- Be genuinely honest - this practice only works with real self-examination
- Do not use this as another way to focus on the other person's faults
- Acknowledge that finding fault in yourself doesn't mean excusing others
- Recognize that sometimes self-examination reveals you are indeed in the right - but even then, consider your manner of being right
- This practice precedes action; it doesn't replace appropriate action
- Self-examination is not self-flagellation; be honest, not harsh

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Anti-Pattern 1: Performative Self-Examination
**What it looks like:** Going through the motions to prove you've "done the work" before attacking
**Why it fails:** The examination must be genuine or it accomplishes nothing
**Better approach:** Actually be willing to find fault in yourself; stay with discomfort

### Anti-Pattern 2: Using This to Avoid Necessary Confrontation
**What it looks like:** Finding endless faults in yourself to avoid addressing real problems in others
**Why it fails:** Self-examination precedes action; it doesn't replace it
**Better approach:** After genuine examination, take appropriate action from a cleaner place

### Anti-Pattern 3: Self-Examination as Weapon
**What it looks like:** "I've examined myself, now YOU need to..."
**Why it fails:** Using your examination to pressure others misses the point entirely
**Better approach:** Self-examination is about you, not about leverage over them

### Anti-Pattern 4: Surface Examination
**What it looks like:** Quick acknowledgment of minor faults while avoiding the real ones
**Why it fails:** The practice requires courage to see what you don't want to see
**Better approach:** Ask: What am I most afraid to admit about my role in this?

## Examples

### Example 1: Business Partnership Conflict

**Input:** "My business partner keeps missing deadlines and making excuses. I'm doing all the work while they coast. How do I get them to pull their weight?"

**Self-Examination Practice:**

**Situation:**
Business partnership where one party feels they're carrying the load while the other underperforms.

**The Other (as you see them):**
Your partner misses deadlines, makes excuses, and doesn't pull their weight. You feel burdened, resentful, perhaps even exploited.

**The Three Points:**

**1. Loyalty**
- Have I been truly loyal to my partner's interests?
- When I've noticed their struggles, have I sought to understand or just to judge?
- Have I communicated my concerns in service of the partnership, or in venting my frustration?
- Have I represented them fairly to others, or have I complained about them?

*Honest assessment:* I may have been speaking to others about my frustrations before speaking clearly to them. I may have assumed bad intent rather than inquiring into what's happening for them.

**2. Trustworthiness**
- Have I kept my word in this partnership?
- Have I been clear about my expectations, or assumed they would know?
- Did I make agreements about workload that I'm now silently modifying?
- Have I been honest about my growing resentment, or let it fester unspoken?

*Honest assessment:* I haven't directly said "I feel I'm doing more than my share." I've made hints and shown frustration, but I haven't been trustworthy in speaking clearly.

**3. Practice**
- Am I practicing what I expect of them?
- Do I meet my own deadlines with the same standard I hold them to?
- When I struggle, do I make excuses they might consider similar to theirs?
- Am I modeling the communication I want from them?

*Honest assessment:* I do sometimes run late on things and explain why. I might call those "reasons" while I call theirs "excuses." The standard might not be as one-sided as I've told myself.

**The Mirror:**
The "excuses" I'm frustrated with - do I make them too?
The failure to communicate - am I doing the same by not addressing this directly?
The coasting - is there any part of this partnership where I coast?

Perhaps what frustrates me most is seeing in them a tendency I fear in myself.

**My Contribution:**
- I accepted a partnership structure without clear agreements about workload
- I didn't raise concerns when they were small; now they're large
- I've built resentment silently, which poisons my interactions
- I may have taken on work without being asked, then resented the imbalance I created
- I haven't modeled the direct, honest communication I want

**What I Control:**
| Within my control | Within my influence | Outside my control |
|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Speaking clearly about my experience | Proposing new agreements | Whether they change |
| Managing my resentment | Modeling the work ethic I want | Their priorities |
| Deciding if this partnership works for me | Requesting accountability structures | Their excuses |
| My own deadline discipline | The tone of our relationship | Their capacity |

**The Path Forward:**
Before demanding change from my partner:
1. Acknowledge that I haven't been trustworthy in communication - I owe them clarity before criticism
2. Examine whether my standards for them are the same as for myself
3. Have a direct conversation about my experience: "I feel I'm carrying more of the load. I want to understand your perspective, and I want to share mine honestly."
4. Propose concrete structures rather than demanding character change

**If I Change First:**
If I model direct, honest communication instead of resentful hinting, the conversation becomes possible. If I take responsibility for my failure to address this sooner, I invite them to take responsibility too. If I ask genuine questions about their experience, I might learn something that changes my understanding.

And if, after genuine self-examination and clear communication, they still don't fulfill their role - then I can act from clarity rather than accumulated resentment.

### Example 2: Parenting Frustration

**Input:** "My teenager never listens to me. I give advice and they do the opposite just to spite me. How do I get through to them?"

**Self-Examination Practice:**

**Situation:**
Parent feels unheard and disrespected by teenage child who seems to reject all guidance.

**The Other (as you see them):**
Your teenager is defiant, ignores your wisdom, makes poor choices, and seems to do the opposite of what you suggest specifically because you suggested it.

**The Three Points:**

**1. Loyalty**
- When I give advice, is it truly for their benefit or to satisfy my own need to be right/helpful?
- Do I listen to THEM as much as I want them to listen to ME?
- Am I loyal to their development as a separate person, or to my image of who they should be?

*Honest assessment:* I may give advice more than I listen. I may be more committed to my vision for them than to who they actually are.

**2. Trustworthiness**
- When they do share with me, do I keep confidences?
- Have I used their vulnerabilities against them later?
- Do I follow through on my commitments to them?
- Can they trust me with their truth?

*Honest assessment:* I may have reacted badly to things they shared, making them less likely to share again. They may not trust me to hear them without judgment.

**3. Practice**
- Do I model the listening I want from them?
- Do I accept feedback as well as I give it?
- When I was their age, did I take all my parents' advice?
- Am I as open to changing my mind as I want them to be?

*Honest assessment:* I don't take their feedback well. I probably didn't follow all my parents' advice either. I want them to be more open than I am.

**The Mirror:**
Their defiance - is it different from my insistence?
Their certainty that they're right - am I not equally certain?
Their not listening - do I listen to them?

**My Contribution:**
- I may have given advice in ways that feel like criticism
- I may have not earned the trust that makes advice receivable
- I may lecture instead of converse
- I may have made it clear their job is to listen, not to be heard

**What I Control:**
| Within my control | Within my influence | Outside my control |
|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| How I communicate | The warmth of our relationship | Their choices |
| Whether I listen | My availability for real conversation | Their response to me |
| My reactions when they share | Creating safety for honesty | Their development timeline |

**The Path Forward:**
1. Listen more than advise for one week
2. Ask questions instead of giving answers
3. Share experiences instead of instructions
4. Rebuild trust by responding better when they do share

**If I Change First:**
If I become someone safe to talk to, they might talk. If I listen before advising, my advice might be heard. If I model openness, I might receive it in return.

### Example 3: Daily Examination Practice

**Input:** "I want to use this as a daily practice, not just for conflicts. How would I examine myself at the end of each day?"

**Daily Self-Examination Practice:**

Each evening, review the day using the three points:

**Loyalty:**
- Today, did I truly serve the interests of those I advised or helped?
- Did I tell people what served them, or what served me?
- When I wasn't with people, did I represent them fairly?
- Where did I fall short?

**Trustworthiness:**
- Today, did I keep my word?
- Did my actions match my statements?
- Where did I say one thing and do another?
- What commitments did I neglect?

**Practice:**
- Today, did I live according to the standards I hold others to?
- Did I give advice I don't follow?
- Did I criticize faults I possess?
- Where was I a hypocrite?

**Closing:**
- What one thing will I do differently tomorrow?
- What do I need to repair?
- What am I grateful for?

This practice takes 5-10 minutes. Done consistently, it shapes character over time.

## Integration

**Works well with:**
- **stoic-evening-review** - Similar daily examination from Stoic tradition
- **premeditatio-malorum** - Preparing for challenges before they arise
- **feedback-reception** - Receiving criticism with grace

**When to prefer this over alternatives:**
- When interpersonal conflict involves frustration with others
- When the impulse is to change someone else
- When daily moral cultivation is the goal

**Cautions:**
- Can become self-blame if practiced without balance
- Does not replace necessary confrontation - precedes it
- Requires courage to see what you don't want to see
